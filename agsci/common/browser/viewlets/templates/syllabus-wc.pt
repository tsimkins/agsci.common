<h2>Penn State Policies</h2>
<h3>Login Policy</h3>
<p>Students are expected to log in regularly to keep up to date with announcements, discussions, etc. The class will progress at a regular pace throughout the semester and there are specific due dates and times for assignments, etc.</p>
<h3>Course Availability</h3>
<p>Your course will be available to you beginning the first day of class and will remain open for one year. After one year the course will close.</p>
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest, and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle.</p>
<p>According to Penn State policy <a href="https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html" title="G-9: Academic Integrity">G-9: Academic Integrity</a>, an academic integrity violation is "an intentional, unintentional, or attempted violation of course or assessment policies to gain an academic advantage or to advantage or disadvantage another student academically." Unless your instructor tells you otherwise, you must complete all course work entirely on your own, using only sources that have been permitted by your instructor, and you may not assist other students with papers, quizzes, exams, or other assessments. If your instructor allows you to use ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person (e.g., from Course Hero or Chegg) or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, you must identify their source. You may not submit false or fabricated information, use the same academic work for credit in multiple courses, or share instructional content. Students with questions about academic integrity should ask their instructor <strong>before submitting work</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Students facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from the affected course</strong> unless they are cleared of wrongdoing (see <a href="https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html" title="G-9: Academic Integrity">G-9: Academic Integrity</a>). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean's List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College.</p>
