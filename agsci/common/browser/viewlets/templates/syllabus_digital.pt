    <h2>Penn State Policies</h2>
    <h3>Log-In Policy</h3>
    <p>Students are expected to log-in regularly to keep up-to-date with announcements, discussions, etc. The class will progress at a regular pace throughout the semester and there are specific due dates and times for assignments, etc.</p>
    <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
    <p>Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, students should act with personal integrity, respect other students' dignity, rights, and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts. Academic integrity includes a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others (see <a href="http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/47-00-48-00-and-49-00-grades/#49-20" title="Faculty Senate Policy 49-20">Faculty Senate Policy 49-20</a>, <a href="http://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html" title="G-9 Procedures">G-9 Procedures</a> and the <a href="https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/conduct" title="Student Code of Conduct">Code of Conduct</a>).</p>
    <p>Read the <a href="http://agsci.psu.edu/students/resources/academic-integrity/" title="Academic Integrity">Academic Integrity Guidelines for the College of Agricultural Sciences</a></p>
    <p>A lack of knowledge or understanding of the University's Academic Integrity policy and the types of actions it prohibits and/or requires does not excuse one from complying with the policy. Penn State and the College of Agricultural Sciences take violations of academic integrity very seriously. Faculty, alumni, staff and fellow students expect each student to uphold the University's standards of academic integrity both inside and outside of the classroom.</p>
